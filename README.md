# DNA-sequence-processing
Takes FASTA sequence files as input, and generates a report outlining important metrics (coding done in Perl). Metrics include total, minimum, and maximum sequence length, average sequence length, and individual nucleotide/CpG site counts and proportions. The main program file is Jenkins_assign2.pl and the web interface program file is Assign4_Jenkins.pl.
